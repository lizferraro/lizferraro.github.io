                    <p>As a business owner in the real estate industry, I filled many roles depending on what the day required. At times I was a client relationship manager, a transaction coordinator, a data analytics cruncher, a marketer, a social media marketer, an SOP creator, the on-call IT person, and also an amateur website developer. I also owned and operated a successful Airbnb rental property. I most enjoyed working on the data and the website, which played a big part in my decision to turn toward tech for a fresh start.</p>
                    <h3>Technical Writer for Cygnet Leadership Solutions, 2015-2017</h3>
                    <p>In this role, I primarily worked on content development projects for the workshops led by our instructors. A critical part of this process was communicating, discovering, and assessing client needs and goals so that our team could develop training programs that effectively achieved the client's desired outcomes.</p>
                    <h3>Administrative Assistant in the Real Estate Industry, 2013-2015</h3>

In addition, I learned a good deal about customer service as I was also responsible for handling customer issues and resolving complaints.</p>
                    <h3>Cryptologic Linguest for the Army National Guard, 2009-2013</h3>
                    <p>In this position, I achieved a "General Professional Proficiency" rating in Persian-Farsi, and I completed fundamental SIGINT training with a focus on foreign language traffic. In my free time I volunteered as a language tutor for struggling students and those seeking to improve their language skills.</p>
