                    <p>As a business owner in the real estate industry, I filled many roles depending on what the day required. At times I was a client relationship manager, a transaction coordinator, a data analytics cruncher, a marketer, a social media marketer, an SOP creator, the on-call IT person, and also an amateur website developer. I also owned and operated a successful Airbnb rental property. I most enjoyed working on the data and the website, which played a big part in my decision to turn toward tech for a fresh start.</p>
                    <h3>Technical Writer for Cygnet Leadership Solutions, 2015-2017</h3>
                    <p>In this role, I primarily worked on content development projects for the workshops led by our instructors. A critical part of this process was communicating, discovering, and assessing client needs and goals so that our team could develop training programs that effectively achieved the client's desired outcomes.</p>
                    <h3>Administrative Assistant in the Real Estate Industry, 2013-2015</h3>
                    <p>I wore many hats in this position to include managing SEO and social media, maintaining websites, developing print and digital marketing materials, processing payments and rental applications, managing customer databases, and managing property listings and transaction schedules. In addition, I learned a good deal about customer service as I was also responsible for handling customer issues and resolving complaints.</p>
                    <h3>Cryptologic Linguest for the Army National Guard, 2009-2013</h3>
                    <p>In this position, I achieved a "General Professional Proficiency" rating in Persian-Farsi, and I completed fundamental SIGINT training with a focus on foreign language traffic. In my free time I volunteered as a language tutor for struggling students and those seeking to improve their language skills.</p>
